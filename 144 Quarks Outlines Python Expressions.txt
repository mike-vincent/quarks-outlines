## An Overview of Python Expressions

### What is a Python expression?

When you write a line in Python that gives a value, that line is called an **expression**. A **Python expression** is any piece of code that Python can run and produce a value. An expression can be a number, a string, a function call, or even a full equation.

When Python sees an expression, it runs it and gives the result. You can use expressions in assignments, in function arguments, and in control structures like `if` or `while`. Every expression produces a value.

**Python lets you write expressions to compute values.**

```python
x = 2 + 3 * 4
print(x)
# prints:
# 14
```

This expression adds `2` to `3 * 4`. Python runs the expression and assigns the result to `x`.

### What kinds of Python expressions are there?

Python has many kinds of expressions. These include:

- **Arithmetic expressions**, like `3 + 5`  
- **String expressions**, like `'Hello' + 'World'`  
- **Comparison expressions**, like `x > 5`  
- **Function calls**, like `len(data)`  
- **Comprehensions**, like `[x*x for x in range(3)]`  
- **Boolean expressions**, like `x > 5 and y < 10`  

All of these return values. You can use expressions by themselves, or as part of a larger statement.

**Python expressions include math, logic, and function calls.**

```python
name = "Ada"
greeting = "Hello, " + name
print(greeting)
# prints:
# Hello, Ada
```

Here, the string expression `"Hello, " + name` creates a new string and assigns it to `greeting`.

### What happens when Python evaluates an expression?

Python reads an expression from left to right. It uses rules called **precedence** and **associativity** to decide the order of steps. If you use parentheses, you can control that order.

When Python runs the expression, it creates objects, combines values, and calls functions. The result is stored or returned depending on the context.

**Python expressions are evaluated based on rules of order and grouping.**

```python
result = (2 + 3) * 4
print(result)
# prints:
# 20
```

The parentheses make Python add first, then multiply.

## A Historical Timeline of Python Expressions  
**Where do Python’s expression rules come from?**

Python expressions are shaped by rules from math, logic, and earlier programming languages. The design combines simplicity with flexibility, so you can write small pieces that build up to full programs.

---

### People defined expressions as a way to show meaning in code

**1956 —** **Infix notation** used in early math languages to show operations like `a + b`.  
**1960 —** **ALGOL 60** introduced structured expressions with nested function calls and operators.  
**1972 —** **C language** added typed expressions, function calls, and rich operator behavior.

---

### People designed Python expressions for clarity and structure

**1991 —** **Python 0.9.0** supported arithmetic, comparison, logic, function calls, and indexing in expressions.  
**2000 —** **List comprehensions** allowed expressions inside loops for fast value creation.  
**2006 —** **Generator expressions** added lazy evaluation to Python expressions using parentheses.  
**2018 —** **Assignment expressions** using `:=` allowed values to be assigned as part of expressions.  
**2025 —** **Python expressions** now include pattern match expressions, comprehension blocks, and more — all still readable and simple.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Expressions  
**How do you use Python expressions the right way?**

Python expressions let you build results from simple rules. They work with numbers, text, logic, and many more types. These problems show how Python expressions help you get useful results with just one line.

### Problem: How do you combine values into one result in Python?

You are writing a program that calculates prices. You have a quantity and a unit price. You want to multiply them and show the result, but you do not want to write many lines of code.

**Problem:** You want to join values into one result using math.  
**Solution:** Python expressions let you combine numbers with operators.

**Python lets you use arithmetic expressions to compute values.**

```python
price = 10
quantity = 3
total = price * quantity
print(total)
# prints:
# 30
```

The expression `price * quantity` computes the value and stores it in `total`.

### Problem: How do you check a condition in one line in Python?

You are checking if someone is allowed to enter. You want to know if their age is 18 or older. You want the check to be clear and simple.

**Problem:** You want to test a value using logic.  
**Solution:** Python expressions let you compare values and get a result.

**Python lets you write comparison expressions for checks.**

```python
age = 20
print(age >= 18)
# prints:
# True
```

This expression returns `True` if the age is 18 or more. You can use it in an `if` block or print it directly.

---

### Problem: How do you call a function and use the result in Python?

You have a string and you want to know how many letters it has. You do not want to write a separate function or loop.

**Problem:** You want to call a built-in function inside an expression.  
**Solution:** Python expressions can include function calls.

**Python lets you call a function and use its return value.**

```python
word = "hello"
length = len(word)
print(length)
# prints:
# 5
```

The `len(word)` expression returns a number, and Python assigns that value to `length`.

---

### Problem: How do you create a list with one line of logic in Python?

You need a list of the first five square numbers. You do not want to write a loop. You want to write the logic in one step.

**Problem:** You want to build a new list from a pattern.  
**Solution:** Python lets you use expressions inside a list comprehension.

**Python lets you use list comprehensions as expressions.**

```python
squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]
print(squares)
# prints:
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

The expression inside the brackets runs for each number in the range and builds the list in one line.

---

### Problem: How do you assign and test a value at the same time in Python?

You want to get input and test it in one line. You want to avoid writing the assignment and the `if` check on separate lines.

**Problem:** You want to assign a value while checking it.  
**Solution:** Python expressions support the `:=` assignment expression.

**Python lets you assign a value and use it at once.**

```python
text = "Hello world"
if (n := len(text)) > 5:
    print("Length is", n)
# prints:
# Length is 11
```

The expression `(n := len(text))` sets `n` and returns the value. This lets you write less code and keep things clear.
