# Quark’s Outlines: Python Dictionaries  
*Overview, Historical Timeline, Problems & Solutions*

## An Overview of Python Dictionaries

### What is a Python dictionary?

You use a dictionary when you want to look up a value using a key. In real life, you might use a dictionary to look up the meaning of a word. In Python, you use a dictionary to look up a value using a word, number, or other key.

A Python dictionary is a built-in type that holds a set of key–value pairs. You use it when you want to store and retrieve data using keys instead of numbers. Keys must be unique and must not change.

**Python lets you create dictionaries using braces and colons.**

```python
person = {"name": "Ada", "age": 36}
print(person["name"])   # prints: Ada
```

The braces `{}` hold the dictionary. Each entry inside has a key and a value, separated by a colon `:`.

### How do keys and values work in a Python dictionary?

Each key in a Python dictionary points to one value. You cannot have the same key twice. A key can be a number, string, or tuple. A value can be anything.

When you write `d[k]`, you get the value for key `k` in dictionary `d`. You can also use this form to add or change entries. If the key is not found, Python will raise an error unless you use a safe method.

**Python lets you access and update dictionary values using square brackets.**

```python
d = {"a": 1}
print(d["a"])     # prints: 1
d["b"] = 2
print(d["b"])     # prints: 2
```

You can also use the `.get()` method to get a value safely. If the key is missing, `.get()` returns `None` or a value you choose.

### Are Python dictionaries mutable?

Yes. Python dictionaries are mutable. This means you can add, remove, or update key–value pairs after the dictionary is created.

**Python lets you change a dictionary after you create it.**

```python
data = {"a": 1}
data["b"] = 2
del data["a"]
print(data)   # prints: {'b': 2}
```

You can use `del` to remove a key. You can use `.clear()` to remove all keys.

### What types can be used as keys in Python dictionaries?

A Python dictionary key must not change. This means you cannot use lists or other dictionaries as keys. You can use strings, numbers, or tuples that contain only strings or numbers.

**Python lets you use fixed types like strings and numbers as keys.**

```python
lookup = {1: "one", "two": 2, (3, 4): "pair"}
print(lookup["two"])    # prints: 2
print(lookup[(3, 4)])   # prints: pair
```

If you use a key that changes, Python will raise an error when you try to use it.

## A Historical Timeline of Python Dictionaries  
**Where do Python’s dictionary rules come from?**

Python dictionaries come from the idea of using a key to find a value. This idea started in early programming and grew as languages added better tools for storing structured data. Python shaped dictionaries to be fast, safe, and easy to use.

---

### People invented key–value storage

**1956 — Hashing in Symbol Tables** IBM used hashing to store and find values by name in early compilers.  
**1973 — Associative arrays in AWK** AWK added dynamic arrays with named keys for text processing.

### People designed Python dictionaries

**1991 — Built-in dictionaries with `{}` syntax** Python 0.9.0 added dictionaries with literal notation and subscript access.  
**2000 — Dictionary views and `.get()` method** Python 2.0 introduced `.get()` and views for keys, values, and items.

### People expanded dictionary features

**2010 — Dictionary comprehensions** Python 3.0 added `{k: v for k, v in iterable}` syntax for fast creation.  
**2016 — Dictionary insertion order preserved** Python 3.6 preserved the order of insertion as an implementation detail.  
**2018 — Ordered dictionaries by design** Python 3.7 made insertion order an official part of the language.  

### People protected dictionary behavior

**2023 — Key rules unchanged** Python continued to forbid mutable types as keys to protect consistency.  
**2025 — Core dictionary type stable** Python did not add new built-in mapping types or change the dictionary model.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Dictionaries  
**How do you use Python dictionaries the right way?**

Dictionaries help you match keys to values. You can look up names, counts, or any data by using a clear and simple key. The examples below show problems you face in daily tasks and how Python solves them with dictionaries.

---

### Problem: How do you group facts about one thing in Python?

You are writing a program to store facts about a person. You could use a list, but then you must remember the order of each item. You want a way to label each fact with a name.

**Problem:** A list of values does not let you label each part clearly.  
**Solution:** Use a dictionary so each value is stored under a key that tells what it is.

**Python lets you store labeled data using dictionaries.**

```python
person = {"name": "Ada", "age": 36}
print(person["name"])    # prints: Ada
```

The key `"name"` tells what the value means. You do not need to guess the order of items.

---

### Problem: How do you check if a key exists before using it in Python?

You are using data from a user, and you are not sure if all the expected keys are present. If you try to use a missing key, Python raises an error.

**Problem:** Using a missing key with `[]` causes a crash.  
**Solution:** Use `.get()` to check for the key safely and return a default if it is missing.

**Python lets you safely check for missing keys using `.get()`.**

```python
data = {"name": "Ada"}
print(data.get("age"))         # prints: None
print(data.get("age", 0))      # prints: 0
```

You can also check if a key exists using the `in` keyword.

---

### Problem: How do you count things efficiently in Python?

You are counting how many times each word appears in a list. You do not want to write a long list of if-statements.

**Problem:** Manually tracking counts is slow and error-prone.  
**Solution:** Use a dictionary to store each word and update the count each time it appears.

**Python lets you count values fast using keys.**

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple"]
counts = {}

for word in words:
    counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1

print(counts)    # prints: {'apple': 2, 'banana': 1}
```

Each key holds the count for that word. You use `.get()` to start at 0 the first time.

---

### Problem: How do you update part of a record in Python?

You have a dictionary with several values, and you want to change just one. You do not want to create a new object each time.

**Problem:** Updating many fields without structure takes time.  
**Solution:** Use dictionary assignment to change only the key you need.

**Python lets you update one value by using its key.**

```python
profile = {"name": "Ada", "age": 36}
profile["age"] = 37
print(profile)    # prints: {'name': 'Ada', 'age': 37}
```

This is fast and clear. You only touch what you need.

---

### Problem: How do you store data with non-string keys in Python?

You are mapping points on a grid to values. Using strings as keys is slow and hard to manage.

**Problem:** Strings as keys do not help when your data is numeric or spatial.  
**Solution:** Use tuples as keys to store positions or combinations.

**Python lets you use tuples as keys to store structured data.**

```python
grid = {}
grid[(0, 0)] = "start"
grid[(1, 2)] = "checkpoint"
print(grid[(1, 2)])    # prints: checkpoint
```

The tuple key holds two numbers. You can now look up a location using `(x, y)`.
