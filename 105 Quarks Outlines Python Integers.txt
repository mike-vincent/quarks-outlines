# Quark’s Outlines: Python Integers  
*Overview, Historical Timeline, Problems & Solutions*

## An Overview of Python Integers

### What is a Python integer?

You use numbers every day to count, measure, and compare. In Python, a number without a decimal point is called an **integer**. A Python integer stands for a whole number, like `-3`, `0`, or `42`.

Python creates integer objects when you write whole numbers in code. These are called **integer literals**. When Python sees a number like `100`, it creates an integer object holding that value.

**Python lets you create whole-number objects using integer literals.**

```python
a = 100
print(a)           # prints 100
print(type(a))     # prints <class 'int'>
```

### Are Python integers limited?

In older systems, integers had fixed size limits. But in Python, integers can grow as large as the memory allows. Python integers use as many digits as needed.

Python used to separate small integers ("plain") from large ones ("long"). Now they are both one type: `int`. You do not need to worry about size. If your number fits in memory, Python can store it.

**Python lets you write very large integers without overflow.**

```python
b = 123456789123456789123456789
print(b)           # prints the full number
```

### How are Python integers stored?

Python integers are immutable. That means once you create an integer, its value cannot change. You can assign a new value to the name, but the original integer object stays the same.

Integers use binary notation internally. This lets Python perform fast operations like shifts, masks, and bitwise logic.

**Python stores integers in binary and uses them safely.**

```python
c = 7
print(bin(c))      # prints 0b111
```

## A Historical Timeline of Python Integers  
**Where do Python’s integer types come from?**

Python’s handling of integers has changed over time. Early designs used two types for small and large numbers. Later versions unified them to avoid surprises. This timeline shows how humans shaped Python integers.

---

### People invented ways to represent whole numbers

**1958 —** **Fixed-width integers** IBM FORTRAN used 16- and 32-bit integers for machine-level math.  
**1972 —** **2's complement integers** C used binary formats with sign bits for fast negative number support.

### People designed Python’s first integer types

**1991 —** **Plain and long integers** Python 0.9.0 used two types: small integers (`int`) and large integers (`long`).  
**2001 —** **Better integer behavior** Python 2.2 improved how integers handled shifts and masks.  

### People simplified Python integers

**2007 —** **Unified `int` type** Python 3.0 removed the difference between plain and long integers. All integers became one type.  
**2025 —** **Memory-based integer size** Python core team preserved flexible integer size without new keywords.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Integers  
**How do you use Python integers the right way?**

Python uses integers to represent whole numbers. These can be used in math, logic, and data structures. The problems below show how Python’s integer type helps you express everyday needs.

---

### Problem: How do you count things using whole numbers in Python?

You are keeping track of how many books you read this year. You want to store and print that number. A decimal or fraction would not make sense.

**Problem:** You need to store a count using a number that does not include decimals.

**Solution:** Use a Python integer. Integer literals give you a simple way to store and print whole numbers.

**Python lets you count things with integer values.**

```python
books_read = 12
print("Books read:", books_read)    # prints Books read: 12
```

### Problem: How do you do math without floating point errors in Python?

You are splitting a prize equally among three people. You want to divide without getting decimal points or rounding errors.

**Problem:** You want to use math that keeps results as whole numbers.

**Solution:** Use floor division `//` with Python integers. It divides and removes the remainder.

**Python lets you divide with integers using floor division.**

```python
total_prize = 99
share = total_prize // 3
print("Each person gets:", share)   # prints Each person gets: 33
```

### Problem: How do you work with very large numbers in Python?

You are storing a long ID number from a database. The number has more digits than most calculators show. You are not sure if Python can handle it.

**Problem:** You need to store and use a number that is longer than a normal 32-bit or 64-bit limit.

**Solution:** Python integers grow as large as needed. You do not need a special type for large values.

**Python lets you store large numbers without overflow.**

```python
uid = 987654321987654321987654321
print("User ID:", uid)              # prints full number as User ID: 987654321987654321987654321
```

### Problem: How do you check if a number is even or odd in Python?

You are writing a game. You want to let players take turns only on even rounds. You need to check if a number is even.

**Problem:** You need a way to test a number for evenness.

**Solution:** Use the modulo operator `%`. It gives the remainder after division. If the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder, it is even.

**Python lets you check even and odd values using the modulo operator.**

```python
round = 4
if round % 2 == 0:
    print("Even round")            # prints Even round
else:
    print("Odd round")
```

---

### Problem: How do you work with binary values and bitwise logic in Python?

You are storing a set of flags. Each flag uses one bit. You want to check or change these bits using binary.

**Problem:** You want to set and test binary flags using whole numbers.

**Solution:** Use Python integers with binary notation and bitwise operators.

**Python lets you use binary flags with integers.**

```python
flags = 0b1010
if flags & 0b0010:
    print("Flag 2 is set")         # prints Flag 2 is set
else:
    print("Flag 2 is not set")
```
