## An Overview of Python Strings

### What is a Python string?

You often need to work with words, phrases, or characters in your program. In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. Each character is placed next to the other, in order, inside a pair of quotes. Python lets you use either single quotes or double quotes to mark the start and end of a string.

You can think of a string as a row of letter boxes, each holding one character. The first character is at index 0. You can get a letter by its position, or slice a group of letters.

**Python lets you store and work with text using strings.**

```python
word = "hello"
print(word[0])      # prints h
print(word[1:4])    # prints ell
```

The value `"hello"` is a string. Each letter can be selected using its index. Python gives back a smaller string when you slice it.

### Problem: write and use Python strings

Python strings use quotes. A string can be as short as one letter or as long as a whole book. The quotes tell Python where the string starts and ends. You can write strings using:

- `'text'`
- `"text"`
- `'''text'''` for multi-line strings
- `"""text"""` for multi-line strings

Python also supports **escape characters** inside strings. These use a backslash `\` to show special meaning. For example, `\n` adds a new line, and `\t` adds a tab.

**Python lets you write strings using quotes and escape codes.**

```python
line = "Line 1\nLine 2"
print(line)      # prints:
# Line 1
# Line 2
```

The escape code `\n` tells Python to start a new line. This helps you write text that looks like a paragraph or list.

### What is special about Python strings?

Python strings are **immutable**. Once you create a string, you cannot change its letters. You can make a new string based on it, but not change the original.

Strings can be joined, repeated, and searched. You can use the `+` operator to join two strings. You can use `in` to check if a word appears in a string.

**Python lets you combine strings and search inside them.**

```python
greeting = "Hi" + " " + "there"
print(greeting)          # prints Hi there
print("there" in greeting)  # prints True
```

When you join or test strings, Python gives back a new string or a truth value. This makes it easy to work with names, sentences, and file data.

## A Historical Timeline of Python Strings  
**Where do Python strings come from?**

Strings in Python follow rules from older languages and systems. Each design step helped make string use faster, simpler, or more consistent. This timeline shows the major ideas that shaped Python strings.

---

### People found ways to store and send characters.

**1956 —** Byte storage and ASCII codes let computers save text using numbers.  
**1960 —** ALGOL used quotes to mark strings, setting a model for many languages.  

### People designed Python’s string rules.

**1980 —** ABC language used string blocks and indentation, influencing Python.  
**1991 —** Python 0.9.0 supported strings with indexing, slicing, and quotes.  

### People expanded what strings can hold.

**2001 —** Python 2.2 improved Unicode support for global character sets.  
**2008 —** Python 3.0 made strings Unicode by default and added byte strings.  
**2015 —** Python 3.6 added f-strings to format values inside strings.  
**2023 —** Python core team preserved string features without adding new syntax.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Strings  
**How do you use Python strings the right way?**

You work with strings to show text, store messages, and name things. Python makes this clear and simple, but you must follow its rules. These examples show common needs and how Python strings help solve them.

### Problem: How do you include quote marks inside a string in Python?

You want to show this sentence in your program:  
**He said, "Python is easy."**  
But if you use double quotes for the whole string, the inner quotes break the code.

**Problem:** How do you include quotes inside a string?  
**Solution:** Use escape codes or switch the outer quotes.

**Python lets you use quote marks in strings with escapes.**

```python
quote = "He said, \"Python is easy.\""
print(quote)     # prints He said, "Python is easy."
```

You can also use single quotes for the string if the inside uses double quotes. Python reads both forms correctly.

---

### Problem: How do you split text over multiple lines in Python?

You want to write a block of text with line breaks. Writing it as one long string makes it unreadable and incorrect.

**Problem:** How do you write a multi-line string?  
**Solution:** Use triple quotes or escape codes for new lines.

**Python lets you write long strings using triple quotes.**

```python
note = """First line
Second line
Third line"""
print(note)
# prints:
# First line
# Second line
# Third line
```

Triple quotes let you press return in your code to make real line breaks in the string.

### Problem: How do you find a word in a sentence in Python?

You store a string like `"The quick brown fox"` and want to know if it includes the word `"fox"`.

**Problem:** How do you check if a word is inside a string?  
**Solution:** Use the `in` keyword.

**Python lets you test for parts of a string using `in`.**

```python
sentence = "The quick brown fox"
print("fox" in sentence)     # prints True
print("dog" in sentence)     # prints False
```

The `in` keyword gives back `True` or `False`. This helps you search quickly and write clear conditions.

### Problem: How do you join small pieces into a single string in Python?

You gather pieces like a first name, a space, and a last name. You want one full string, not a list.

**Problem:** How do you join parts into a complete string?  
**Solution:** Use the `+` operator or string formatting.

**Python lets you join strings with `+` or format expressions.**

```python
first = "Ada"
last = "Lovelace"
full = first + " " + last
print(full)      # prints Ada Lovelace
```

You can also use an f-string:  
```python
print(f"{first} {last}")   # prints Ada Lovelace
```

Joining strings makes your output look natural and readable.

---

### Problem: How do you show values inside a message in Python?

You want to say how many items a user has. The number is stored in a variable.

**Problem:** How do you place a variable inside a string?  
**Solution:** Use an f-string to format the value.

**Python lets you insert values into strings with f-strings.**

```python
name = "Alex"
count = 3
print(f"{name} has {count} items.")   # prints Alex has 3 items.
```

The f-string replaces `{name}` and `{count}` with the current values. This gives you a readable result without string math.
