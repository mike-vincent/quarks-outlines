## An Overview of Python Code Blocks

### What is a Python code block?

When you write a Python program, you group statements together. This group is called a **Python code block**. A code block is a section of code that Python can run as one unit. It can be as short as one line or as long as a full module.

You use code blocks in many places. A function body is a code block. A class definition is a code block. Each module you import is also a code block. Python reads these blocks and sets up the right space to run them.

**Python lets you group statements into code blocks that run together.**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Ada")
# prints:
# Hello, Ada
```

The function body is a code block. Python runs it when you call `greet()`.

### Where do Python code blocks appear?

You use code blocks in many parts of Python. Some blocks run once, like a module. Some blocks run many times, like a function. Python sees each block as its own unit, even if it lives inside another.

You also write code blocks in the Python shell, in scripts, or by passing strings to `eval()` or `exec()`.

**Python sees each script, function, class, or command as a code block.**

```python
x = 5
print(x + 2)
# prints:
# 7
```

If you type this into a shell or script, each line is part of the same code block.

## A Historical Timeline of Python Code Blocks  
**Where do Python’s code blocks come from?**

The idea of code blocks comes from early structured programming. Over time, blocks became the way to group logic and manage scope. Python kept this model but used indentation, not braces or symbols, to mark blocks.

---

### People invented structured code blocks

**1960 —** **Structured code flow** in ALGOL introduced the idea of blocks with their own scope and control flow.

**1972 —** **Braced blocks in C** grouped statements using `{}` and used semicolons to end each line.

---

### People designed Python’s code block system

**1991 —** **Indented blocks** in Python 0.9.0 used colons and whitespace to group code without braces.

**1994 —** **Interactive code blocks** in Python shell treated each command as a block with its own scope.

**2000 —** **String-based blocks** added support for `exec()`, `eval()`, and `input()` as ways to run blocks from strings.

**2010 —** **Function scopes improved** with clear separation between local and global name spaces.

**2025 —** **Code block rules stable** and remain central to how Python runs structured code.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Code Blocks  
**How do you use Python code blocks the right way?**

Python code blocks let you group logic, run sections of code, and control how names are stored. These problems show how Python blocks behave in real scripts, shells, and function calls.

---

### Problem: How do you group several lines to run together in Python?

You are writing a function to perform a task. You want to run a few lines together every time you call the function. You need Python to treat these lines as one block.

**Problem:** You need a way to run several statements together.  
**Solution:** Python lets you define a code block using indentation under a `def` or `class`.

**Python lets you create a code block inside a function using indentation.**

```python
def compute():
    x = 2
    y = 3
    print("Result:", x + y)

compute()
# prints:
# Result: 5
```

All indented lines under `def` belong to the same code block. Python runs them together.

---

### Problem: How do you define a block that runs once when imported in Python?

You are writing a module that holds helper functions. You want it to run a small block of code the first time it is imported. This block should not run again.

**Problem:** You want to define a code block that runs once.  
**Solution:** Python treats the module file itself as a code block.

**Python lets each module act as a single code block that runs when imported.**

```python
print("Running my_module.py")
# prints:
# Running my_module.py (on first import only)
```

When Python loads a module, it runs its code block once. Later imports skip it.

---

### Problem: How do you run a block from a string in Python?

You are building a tool that takes user input and runs it as Python code. You want to run full expressions or statements from strings, not just from files.

**Problem:** You want to turn a string into a running code block.  
**Solution:** Python lets you use `exec()` to treat a string as a code block.

**Python lets you run code blocks from strings using exec().**

```python
code = "x = 7\nprint('x is', x)"
exec(code)
# prints:
# x is 7
```

The string is treated like its own code block. Python runs it in the current scope.

---

### Problem: How do you run each line in the Python shell as a block in Python?

You are typing commands into the Python shell. Each line you type runs by itself, but some lines must be grouped (like an `if` block). You want Python to know when the block ends.

**Problem:** You want to run multi-line blocks in the shell.  
**Solution:** Python treats each top-level command or group as its own code block.

**Python runs each group of typed lines as its own code block.**

```python
x = 4
if x > 2:
    print("Big")
# prints:
# Big
```

Python uses indentation to know when the block is complete before it runs it.

---

### Problem: How do you tell where a block ends in Python?

You are reading or editing code. You want to know where a block begins and ends. You want to avoid mistakes from wrong spacing.

**Problem:** You need to see code block boundaries clearly.  
**Solution:** Python uses colons and indentation to mark code blocks.

**Python uses indentation after colons to define the start of each code block.**

```python
def show():
    print("Inside block")
print("Outside block")

show()
# prints:
# Inside block
# Outside block
```

Only the indented line belongs to the `show()` block. The next line with no indent is outside.
