*Overview, Historical Timeline, Problems & Solutions*

## An Overview of Python Built-in Methods

### What is a Python built-in method?

You may already know Python has built-in functions like `len()` and `type()`. A **Python built-in method** is similar but attached to a built-in object. For example, you do not write `append(list, x)`—you call `list.append(x)`.

Built-in methods are written in C. They live inside Python’s core types, like `list`, `dict`, and `str`. Each method is tied to the object it changes or reads from. That object is passed to the method automatically.

**Python lets you use built-in methods to work with built-in types.**

```python
x = [1, 2]
x.append(3)
print(x)
# prints:
# [1, 2, 3]
```

The method `append()` is built into the list type. It changes the list by adding an item to the end.

### How do Python built-in methods work?

When you call a built-in method, Python calls a C function. That C function receives the object as its first input, but you do not need to pass it yourself. Python does it for you.

This only works for built-in objects. For example, when you write `s.upper()` on a string, Python knows to pass `s` to the C code that changes it.

**Python built-in methods act like special tools tied to each type.**

```python
word = "hello"
print(word.upper())
# prints:
# HELLO
```

Here, `upper()` is not a free function—it is a method of the string object.

## A Historical Timeline of Python Built-in Methods  
**Where do Python’s built-in methods come from?**

Python built-in methods came from the need to make object types more useful. In the early years, Python had functions for most tasks. But as Python grew, types like `list`, `dict`, and `str` got their own tools. These tools became methods tied to the object’s shape and purpose.

### People built tools to change objects directly

**1990 —** Python used plain functions for most tasks, like `len(x)` and `type(x)`.

**1991 —** Python 0.9.1 added built-in types like `list`, `dict`, and `str`, each with methods for changing them.

**1995 —** Python 1.3 expanded string methods like `find`, `replace`, and `split`.

**2001 —** Python 2.2 made all built-in types into new-style classes, allowing full method support.

**2008 —** Python 3.0 removed old functions and unified the method system under a consistent object model.

**2025 —** Python built-in methods now include dozens of methods across types like set, bytes, and memoryview.

## Problems & Solutions with Python Built-in Methods  
**How do you use Python built-in methods the right way?**

Python built-in methods help you work with strings, lists, dictionaries, and other core types. You can call them on the object directly. These examples show how built-in methods solve real needs when working with Python data.

### Problem: How do you add an item to a list in Python?

You have a list of items. You want to add one more. You could make a new list, but that takes time and memory. You want to change the list directly.

**Problem:** You need to add a new item to a list in place.  
**Solution:** Python gives you the built-in method `append()` for lists.

**Python lets you grow a list with the append() built-in method.**

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
fruits.append('cherry')
print(fruits)
# prints:
# ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

The method changes the list directly. It adds the item to the end without making a new one.

### Problem: How do you update a value in a dictionary in Python?

You are using a dictionary to track counts. You want to set or change a value for a key. You could use square brackets, but that can fail if the key is missing.

**Problem:** You want to set a key’s value safely in a dictionary.  
**Solution:** Python lets you use the `update()` built-in method.

**Python lets you set or change many values with the update() method.**

```python
scores = {'Alice': 3}
scores.update({'Bob': 5})
print(scores)
# prints:
# {'Alice': 3, 'Bob': 5}
```

The method adds the key if it is missing or updates it if it is there.

---

### Problem: How do you remove whitespace from a string in Python?

You have a string from user input. It has extra spaces before or after the text. You want to remove them before using the string.

**Problem:** You need to trim spaces from the ends of a string.  
**Solution:** Python has the `strip()` built-in method on strings.

**Python lets you clean string edges with the strip() method.**

```python
name = "  Mike  "
print(name.strip())
# prints:
# Mike
```

The method keeps the middle of the string and drops only the outside spaces.

---

### Problem: How do you make a list flat in Python?

You have a list with many repeated items. You want to remove the duplicates while keeping one of each. You also want the result in place if possible.

**Problem:** You want to remove repeated items from a list.  
**Solution:** Python has the `set()` function, but to keep order, use `list(dict.fromkeys())`.

**Python lets you flatten a list by combining built-in methods.**

```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
flat = list(dict.fromkeys(nums))
print(flat)
# prints:
# [1, 2, 3]
```

The method `dict.fromkeys()` keeps the first seen of each item. You then convert it back to a list.

---

### Problem: How do you find a letter in a word in Python?

You have a string and want to know if it includes a certain letter. You want the position where the letter first appears, or nothing if it is not there.

**Problem:** You want to search inside a string for a letter.  
**Solution:** Python gives you the `find()` method on strings.

**Python lets you search strings with the find() built-in method.**

```python
text = "banana"
print(text.find("n"))
# prints:
# 2
```

The method gives the index of the first match or `-1` if not found.
